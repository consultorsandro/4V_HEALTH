# 🩺 4V_HEALTH

**4V_SAUDE** is a Rust-based command-line application designed to provide four essential health checks for individuals, following best practices in software architecture (SOLID principles).

---

## 🚀 Features

- **1️⃣ BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculation**
- **2️⃣ TMB (Basal Metabolic Rate) Calculation**
- **3️⃣ PGC (Body Fat Percentage) Calculation**
- **4️⃣ WHR (Waist-to-Hip Ratio) Calculation**

---

## 🛠️ Technologies

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) – Safe, fast, and modern systems programming language
- Modular architecture for easy maintenance and scalability

## 🧑‍💻 Usage

1. **Build the project:**
   ```sh
   cargo build

2. Run the application:
   cargo run

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform health checks.

📊 Health Checks
Check	Description	Input Required
🟦 BMI	Calculates Body Mass Index	Weight, Height
🔥 TMB	Calculates Basal Metabolic Rate	Weight, Height, Age, Gender
🧮 PGC	Calculates Body Fat Percentage	Weight, Height, Age, Gender
📏 WHR	Calculates Waist-to-Hip Ratio	Gender, Waist, Hip

🧩 SOLID Principles

* Single Responsibility: Each module handles a specific health check.
* Open/Closed: Easily extendable for new checks.
* Liskov Substitution: Interfaces and traits for calculators.
* Interface Segregation: Separate traits for each calculation.
* Dependency Inversion: High-level modules depend on abstractions.
